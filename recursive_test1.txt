In this text, the function deploy_agents() was tested;

deploy_agents(
    system_message="You are an expert researcher on a particular topic. Research about a given query, collect as much information as possible, and generate detailed research results with loads of technique details with all reference links attacheds",
    initial_message="Research about the topic of 'OpenAI', and generate a detailed research report with all reference links attached",
    name="researcher"
)

Here's a basic summary of what happened:
1. The upa 1 (init level) calls the function with a well defined system message!
2. The upa 2 outlines OpenAI
3. The upa 2 deploys another model to find out more in detail about a specific component:

"The task is to research OpenAI. The assistant will need to provide comprehensive details about OpenAI's projects, 
CLIP and Dactyl. Additionally, the assistant needs to gather information regarding any ethical considerations or 
controversies related to OpenAI's work.
  
"Could you provide detailed information about OpenAI's CLIP and Dactyl projects and 
also research about any ethical considerations or controversies associated with OpenAI's work?"

Basically this shit just happened recursively, as expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to User_proxy):

OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) project is designed to understand and interpret both visual and linguistic information synergistically -- it can 'understand' an image in the context of natural language and vice versa. CLIP was specifically created to tackle issues of typical AI systems that are separately trained to understand images and textual information, usually leading to a discrepancy between what a system 'sees' and what it 'reads'. 

The technology behind CLIP leverages the idea that images and their associated text (like captions) found on the internet form a large dataset of paired examples that CLIP uses to learn. By training the model in a contrastive way, the model learns to relate images and text better, thus achieving sophisticated tasks of recognizing and interpreting the perceived objects in a given image with relative context derived from text.

The purpose of the project essentially lies in enabling AI systems to demonstrate greater comprehension of the world by uniquely integrating visual and linguistic understanding. This mixed-modal understanding can unlock a multitude of applications in the field of computer vision, automated reasoning, and much more.

Could you elaborate more on how exactly CLIP works? How does it learn to relate images and text?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to User_proxy):

CLIP uses a unique approach that involves "training the model on a variety of data, tasks and languages all at once". More specifically, it's trained with a large dataset of images and their descriptions. Each of these pairs – image and description – serves as a positive example. Negative examples are randomly drawn from the dataset.

The main objective of this training process is to bring the image and its description closer in the model's representation space, while pushing apart (or contrasting) the image from the negative examples. This is why it's referred to as "contrastive learning". 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. The CLIP model takes an image and a text input. They each pass through their respective encoders – a vision transformer for the image, and a transformer for the text – to turn them into mathematical representations.

2. Each of these representations then has its vector length adjusted to 1 (normalized). This makes it possible for the distance between the image and its caption to be calculated in the model's representation space. 

3. This 'distance' in representation is then turned into a probability that the given caption belongs to the image, using a scaled exponential function (softmax across other image-text pairings in the batch). 

4. The aim of the training process is to optimize the model so that the image and its associated caption are brought closer together, and the image and the negative captions are pushed further apart in the model's representation space. 

With sufficient training, the model learns to generate human-like textual descriptions from any given images, and vice versa, recognizing images that are a good match to a given piece of text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to User_proxy):

OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model is a powerful tool that learns to connect images and text in a sophisticated manner. Here is a deep dive into how it operates:

1. **Image and Text Inputs:**
CLIP takes both an image and a text input. The image input is processed through a Vision Transformer (ViT), a type of deep-learning model designed to handle image tasks. On the other hand, the text input is processed through a transformer model, specifically designed for handling natural language processing tasks.

2. **Through the Encoders:**
CLIP has a specific encoder for each type of input. An image encoder processes the image input, and a text encoder processes the text input. Each of these encoders transforms the input into a numerical vector representation. The image encoder yields an image feature vector, and the text encoder yields a text feature vector.

3. **Vector Normalization:**
A key component of CLIP's process is the normalization of these output vectors. Vectors are normalized to ensure that they have a consistent scale. This is achieved by dividing the vector by its L2 norm, resulting in a vector with a unit length. The main reason for this step is to make sure the vector's magnitude doesn't interfere with model's ability to learn from these vectors accurately.

4. **Converting Distance to Probability:**
Once CLIP has the normalized feature vectors, it needs to compare them. To do this, the model computes the cosine similarity between the image and text vectors. This is a measure that tells us how similar two vectors are, ranging from -1 to 1. The larger the value, the higher the similarity. This cosine similarity is then converted into probabilities using a softmax function. These probabilities represent the similarity between the image-text pairs: the higher the probability, the closer the match between the image and the text.

5. **Training Process:**
During the training phase, CLIP learns to match the correct image and text pairs and differentiate them from incorrect pairs. It does this by minimizing a contrastive loss function. The aim is to bring the vectors of correct image-text pairs closer together (increasing their cosine similarity), while pushing the vectors of incorrect pairs apart (decreasing their cosine similarity). This forms a kind of 'ranking' learning problem, where the correct pairs are ranked higher or given more weight than incorrect pairs. Over time, this causes the model to get better at aligning vectors that accurately describe images with their corresponding text captions.
